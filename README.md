# Huffman-Coding

Huffman coding is a data compression algorithm that takes a file as input and generates a binary file consisting of zeros and ones. The algorithm works by analyzing the frequency of each character in the input file and assigning shorter codes to frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequently occurring characters. The resulting binary file can be decoded back into the original input file.
